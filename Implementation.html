                                        Genetic engineering and synthetic biology are in constant development to improve
                                        society in multiple areas. One important fact that limits the implementation of
                                        many projects and ideas is the release of genetically engineered organisms,
                                        since it is a controversial topic that implies several concerns. Many countries
                                        have regulations regarding the release of engineered organisms and are
                                        developing strategies to ensure their safety towards the environment and the
                                        population. Some of these strategies are novel genetic manipulation techniques,
                                        complex biocontainment systems and new regulatory frameworks to start
                                        implementing engineered organisms in the environment. Engineered organisms have
                                        the potential to improve humanity to a new level, but modern methodologies,
                                        characterizations, risk evaluations, and staged proofs of concept are still
                                        necessary to completely apply engineered organisms and obtain their maximum
                                        capabilities hand to hand with the security of the environment, living organisms
                                        and society.

                                        Our project began with the idea to expand the use of engineering organisms based
                                        on targeting their release. Engineered organisms are applicable to any area of
                                        development and could help improve society in multiple fields, but their use in
                                        uncontrolled environments is restricted because of concerns regarding the
                                        release of engineered organisms. Their impact could include alteration of the
                                        environment, leak of genetic material into wild species, colonization of niches,
                                        diversity decrease and others. We want to change this perspective.
                                        <br><br> The circuit’s design was focused on its application, taking into
                                        account punctual requirements depending on the user’s specifications. If
                                        interested in the specific design objectives of our circuit itself, check out
                                        {Description}. Through our implementation proposal we aim to contextualize and
                                        create real strategies for the introduction of our genetic suicide circuit
                                        across the scientific borders, in addition to assess their possible and probable
                                        implications.
                                        <br><br> Finally, we highlight the advantages and functionality of a system like
                                        ours, which builds upon previous techniques and methodologies to keep expanding

                                        Our suicide circuit is focused on expanding the capacities of GMO´s by
                                        generating an efficient system to control an organism’s life, automatizing its
                                        death to a specific, previously determined moment. Suicide circuits, also known
                                        by the name of “kill-switches”, are biocontainment systems based on the death of
                                        an organism through a specific signal. Different types of kill-switches exist:
                                        activated by physical factors, induced by chemical molecules and some even
                                        activated by RNA interactions (iGEM Ohio State, 2020). Our system differs from
                                        the others in important aspects. First of all, our counter circuit enables the
                                        autonomous time management of our engineered bacteria, making the kill-switch
                                        independent from environmental conditions, contrary to most of the existing kill
                                        switches (Chan, C et al. 2016; Stirling, F et al. 2017). The counter is also
                                        based on sequential logic, quality which allows the system to generate different
                                        outputs from the same input, unlike combinatorial logic, in which the same input
                                        generates the same output. Additionally, the whole system is modular because
                                        each module can be applied and modified individually depending on the purpose,
                                        which grants it robustness, and plenty of personalization and optimization
                                        possibilities. If you want to further understand our circuit’s design please

                                        A counter is a tool that can be used in multiple areas to count a specific event
                                        or situation and obtain information about the count for certain purposes
                                        depending on its use. Counters based on biological elements have been developed
                                        across the years and have many applications in the scientific community, but the
                                        capabilities of a biological counter haven't been expanded and implemented
                                        completely. (Subsoontorn & Endy, 2012). A fully functional biological counter
                                        could work to count events like the proliferation of different kinds of cells,
                                        to determine how many are resistant to antibiotics in a subpopulation or even
                                        count difficult events like circadian cycles. Our suicide circuit contains a
                                        counter module that tracks time through cell division, this mechanism allows to
                                        keep track of the different stages of a bacterial population and the triggering
                                        of a determined event after the final count has successfully been reached. In
                                        our design, this specific event is a controlled death mechanism; however, this
                                        could easily be replaced by any other functional module, such as triggering
                                        specific metabolic pathways. Applications for an organism with limited life are
                                        countless and with our suicide circuit this can start to be implemented, in the
                                        next section we described some applicatations for our system and its
                                        functionality. The counter’s characteristics are described in {Description}.

                                Our suicide circuit can be applied in many areas once it is further improved for a

                                        We all know that the contamination around the world is always increasing. Oil
                                        spills, heavy metals in the soil and pesticides are some of many contaminants
                                        that affect the environment according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
                                        (Philp, 2015) Genetically engineered organisms can improve bioremediation
                                        techniques but are limited because regulatory policies regarding their use in
                                        uncontrolled environments are not completely developed, and their environmental
                                        impact is still a cause for concern.
                                        <br><br> We could apply our system for specific bioremediation applications,
                                        such as wastewater treatment; particularly for the elimination of hazardous
                                        compounds or for bioremediating a contaminated environment in situ to avoid loss
                                        of balance and natural properties. Our system could also complement existing
                                        proposals, just as iGEM NAU-China 2020 project, that aimed for the remediation
                                        of heavy metals using earthworms and engineered bacteria. Its mechanism starts
                                        when the engineered bacteria leave the intestine of the earthworm and, in this
                                        environment, don't have a specific protein and RNA of the earthworm, inducing
                                        the killing circuit. This makes the killswitch dependent on its environment,
                                        which could backfire, since remnants of the specific protein in the bacteria may
                                        affect the efficiency of the circuit. Our circuit could automatize the death
                                        phase and make it independent from the environment.
                                        <br><br> We also talked with professionals that, themselves, suggested the
                                        application of our system for bioremediation aspects. M.Sc. Carola Scholz told
                                        us that our circuit has potential in bioaugmentation studies, water treatment
                                        techniques and environmental assays. PhD. Frank Solano Campos, Lic. Juan Carlos
                                        Hernández and Ph.D. Candidate Kattia Nuñez Montero also mentioned that the

                                        saw an application for metals bioremediation specifically. Bioremediation was
                                        the most agreed upon application across our discussion with different experts
                                        and waster-water treatment was the most specific action of use mentioned by the
                                        specialists in this field.

                                        <br> Biomedicine and therapeutics are always improving due the new technologies
                                        based on biotechnology, genetic engineering and synthetic biology. These areas
                                        can expand the medical field but, according to Amrofell et al 2020, genetic
                                        tools need to be developed to implement engineered organisms as smart treatments
                                        and novel therapies to achieve the application of synthetic biology in medicine
                                        areas. Engineered organisms have been a focus of attention for biomedical
                                        applications, such as diagnosis systems and treatment tools for specific
                                        diseases, and could be great platforms to improve medical strategies (Ruder et
                                        al. 2011). Our circuit offers a new possibility to include methodologies based
                                        on synthetic biology in the medical field. Currently, the development of these
                                        applications is based on generalistic treatments, invasive methodologies and
                                        robust techniques of operation (Bober et al. 2018); we want to implement our
                                        circuit to facilitate these processes by providing a novel mechanism of cellular
                                        death into engineered organisms to target specific diseases and to develop new
                                        therapies based on the patients needs.
                                        <br><br> Our system enables a brand new machinery to implement these ideas to
                                        the real world due to their intrinsic modules that are not found in other
                                        killing or biocontainment systems, such as its autonomy, it's mechanism based on
                                        sequential logic and the evolutionary stability of the modules. We also expect
                                        that our circuit complements promising ideas and projects regarding this area
                                        like iGEM UNILausanne 2020 project. They aimed to make a treatment based on
                                        probiotics to target colorectal cancer, in this case our system could work as a
                                        death mechanism to finish the job of the bacteria in a very useful way. Experts
                                        such as M. Sc. Silvia Castro Piedra valued the impact of our tool in the area,
                                        and suggested that a system like ours could function in an interesting way to
                                        attack pathogenic infections, to prevent severe immune responses, to develop
                                        responsive macrophages that differentiate as needed, to create extracellular
                                        matrices without the need of synthetic materials, and even fibrosis and COVID-19
                                        treatments. PhD. César Rodríguez Sánchez and Lic. Rossy Guillén Watson saw the
                                        applicability of the circuit for making in vivo assays regarding interaction
                                        between bacteria and the organism, and for experimentation with different
                                        pathogenic bacterias, respectively. PhD. Rodrigo Mora Rodríguez told us that it
                                        could be interesting to analyze the mechanism of action of new types of
                                        antibiotics, while Dr. rer. nat. Miguel Rojas suggested the use of this
                                        technology to develop effective in vivo models for drugs and other compounds of
                                        interest. The biomedical field is an area of expansion ready for the
                                        implementation of synthetic biology systems and we aim to do it with our
                                        circuit.

                                        The industrial area has been improved by synthetic biology across the years.
                                        Many areas in the industry, like agriculture development, biofuel synthesis,
                                        pest control systems and the production of diverse compounds like metabolites of
                                        interest and drugs got more efficient due to the use of engineered organisms.
                                        Methodologies based on the use of synthetic biology and engineered organisms for
                                        industry aspects have been a great tool to upgrade the industry itself, but, can
                                        we go further? We think that our circuit could allow new mechanisms for diverse
                                        industry processes either to improve existing methodologies to increase their
                                        efficiency and applicability or to establish new ones due to the intrinsic
                                        characteristics of our construct. Optimizing the conditions for the production
                                        of specific biomolecules, preventing their misfolding and aggregation;
                                        industrial processes involving intracellular metabolites and their timely
                                        liberation, along with the reduction of involved hardware and the independence
                                        from environmental conditions; and the production of determined food like beer
                                        or yogurt with desired conditions and properties, like the inability to isolate
                                        them from the final product, allowing a business model based on this exclusivity
                                        are some of the applications that our circuit could be used for in the
                                        industrial area. Other strategies could be developed from functions of interest
                                        such as the augmentation of bioavailability of phosphorus in soil, the ability
                                        to co-culture in fermentations in order to align resources, and the optimized
                                        trying out of different conditions. Also our system could complement industrial
                                        ideas like iGEM UM Macau 2020 project, they proposed an interesting system to
                                        remove the biofilm formation inside aquariums and ocean parks. Our circuit could
                                        complement their system in the moment when it’s necessary to remove the
                                        engineered bacteria after finishing its biofilm degradation job. Additionally,
                                        we received feedback from experts, PhD. Karla Meneses Montero and M. Sc. Raúl
                                        Trejos Espinoza, who suggested applications for our circuit in industry aspects.
                                        They mention that it could be very useful as a biocontrol system for bacteria
                                        and to diminish production costs in optimized systems as fermentations by
                                        improving strategies of use, respectively.

                                        Biosensors are analytical tools that work to detect one or more specific
                                        compounds in a complex system such as an uncontrolled environment. Some
                                        organisms are engineered to be used in biosensing applications to target and
                                        detect molecules in a simpler and efficient way. Our circuit would allow the
                                        development of new systems of biosensing that are based on an expected death of
                                        the organism after the biosensing application. This is useful for applications
                                        such as detection of diseases that are difficult to prevent, toxic compounds’
                                        detection in an open environment or to verify the quality of a molecule of
                                        interest. In some cases the biosensing of a sample can be difficult due to its
                                        complex calibration and detection limit, this can cause false negatives or false
                                        positives when we analyze a system with a biosensor; these factors have caused
                                        the implementation of biosensors to be slow. It is necessary to increase the
                                        robustness of these systems to incorporate its capacities and utilities across
                                        other fields.
                                        <br><br> Due to the killing mechanism of our circuit, all the parameters can be
                                        optimized to expect the death of the organism in a specific moment of the growth
                                        and development of the organism, in relation to its biosensing ability, as
                                        required. This can be applied and implemented to multiple projects that propose
                                        biosensors like the iGEM Hannover 2020 project. They aimed to design a biosensor
                                        that detects the formation of a biofilm in a patient’s implant to avoid the
                                        caused inflammations and infections across the body. We think that our
                                        autonomous suicide circuit could fit very well inside this project because it
                                        could allow the development of a limited life biosensor to incorpored it in a
                                        uncontrolled system like the human body. Dr.rer.nat Miguel Rojas Chaves
                                        suggested that a system like ours could work to further analyze how a specific
                                        bacteria reacts to certain components and to obtain effectiveness models of
                                        these compounds.

                                            <p class="">
                                                To identify potential risks and hazards, we made a risk assessment to
                                                analyze the potential affectations that our circuit could be involved
                                                in. It’s important to prevent and note the potential impacts that our
                                                technology could have, in order to establish its correct use and
                                                implementation. For the development of the risk assessment we followed
                                                several steps to perform it in the best way. First we identified the
                                                potential risks, in which we define circuits malfunction, environmental
                                                interactions, bioterrorism and the dual-use of our technology as our
                                                main risks. It is important to consider that no system is perfect, some
                                                issues can appear and affect the functionality of the circuit. External
                                                and internal factors could affect the mechanism of the circuit and it is
                                                crucial to denote these aspects and solve them to ensure the stability
                                                and robustness of the circuit. The environmental interactions of our
                                                engineered bacteria with the wild organisms in an uncontrolled system is
                                                also an extremely relevant issue to contemplate. Introducing an external
                                                organism into an open environment like a wetland or inside another
                                                organism causes the preoccupation of how the engineered organism can
                                                affect or influence other living beings in different forms. For
                                                bioterrorism, we came to the conclusion that society itself could get
                                                harmed due to the possibility of a bioweapon developed based on our
                                                circuit. For the dual-use of our technology we focused most on the
                                                applicability of the circuit. We discuss that our circuit could be
                                                useful to facilitate the improvement and innovation in areas of
                                                interest, but could also be misused due to its capacities and
                                                characteristics. Below we described in a more punctual way these four
                                                potential risks, their considerations and strategies to tackle them to
                                                ensure safety.

                                            <h3>Circuits Malfunction</h3>

                                            <p class="">
                                                Biological systems can malfunction depending on the construct stability;
                                                the factors on their environment like pH, temperature or can affect the
                                                development and functionality of a system. If a factor is too strong it
                                                can disable the system completely. In our case, we need to ensure the
                                                robustness of the different modules of our system to archive its correct
                                                work. The initial repression, the count mechanism, the expand count and
                                                the kill-switch need to function as a whole to generate a correct use in
                                                a specific application. Internal factors like mutations and genetic
                                                material degradation can affect the circuit, this issue is assessed in
                                                {Description-Characteristics}. On the other hand, external factors could
                                                also affect the correct function of the system. It is necessary to
                                                consider that these elements are more unpredictable, and include the
                                                natural death of the engineered bacteria in the environment or the
                                                extrinsic affectations of the modules by the environmental parameters
                                                like pH. It is possible to reduce these affections by thoroughly
                                                analyzing the target environment in which the system is going to
                                                function and troubleshoot every possibility of malfunction in that
                                                specific area. The malfunction of the circuit is part of it and its
                                                development, but we can take actions to ensure its correct function and
                                                minimize the risk of failure of the system.

                                            <h3>Environmental interactions</h3>

                                            <p class="">
                                                The introduction of engineered organisms into an open environment causes
                                                the interaction between the engineered organisms and the different parts
                                                of the ecosystem. Singh et al mention that efforts should be made to
                                                examine the performance of survival and potential gene transfer of
                                                engineered bacteria because these aspects can affect the endogenous
                                                organism in the environment. To tackle this type of issue it is
                                                important to include a robust biocontainment system to avoid leaks of
                                                genetic material into wild bacterias in the first place. Also it is
                                                crucial to determine all the overall risks that the engineered bacteria
                                                could have in the open environment and make multiple assays to see the
                                                interaction of the engineered organism with the parameters of the
                                                expected space of application. Characterizing the environment of
                                                implementation and making the correct optimization of the system makes
                                                it easier to anticipate potential interactions between the engineered
                                                organism and the environment. Taking into consideration all these
                                                factors would ensure the correct development and expected performance of
                                                the desired system. Singh et al also highlight that there's no evidence
                                                that engineered organisms have caused a significant adverse impact on
                                                the natural community but since the possibility exists and it is an
                                                important risk that we need to consider for the expected application and
                                                real implementation of our system.

                                            <h3>Bioterrorism</h3>
                                            <p>Bioterrorism is based on the use of biological elements to propagate death and damage to living beings. Biological elements like bacterias, viruses and toxins with specific characteristics are normally in the eye of bioterrorists to use them as hazardous weapons to affect the integrity of the society. We consider that our circuit could have a potential as a biological weapon, thus all the problems of bioterrorism should be contemplated as a safety aspect. In one of multiple worst scenarios our circuit could be implemented into a dangerous organism to spread a disease or toxin; then the organism would just be eliminated leaving no trace. The fight against bioterrorism is always in development; methodologies for regulations about dangerous pathogens, surveillance, detection, response and risk communication are in constant improvement to minimize bioterrorism and its consequences. We expect that our system will never be used as a biological weapon, but it is important to mark bioterrorism as a possible risk to ensure safety of our technology and society. To prevent these types of dangerous actions based on biological parts, it is important to develop a plan of action to reduce the risk of a bioterrorism attack. Also the divulgation of information generated by experts about these risks helps the understanding of the population to know how to act and minimize the issue.</p>


                                            <h3>Dual-use implementation</h3>
                                            <p>Dual-use implementation refers to the application of a technology for multiple objectives in a specific moment, where these objectives can be for good purposes or not. This aspect can promote the use of a system in a way not stipulated or expected, i.e. an incorrect use. This incorrect use or misuse can be generated by the potential capacities and intraspecific qualities of a technology. In our case, this issue could affect our circuit in practically any area. To make it more demonstrative, let's consider the bioremediation area. Having an organism incorporated with our circuit that degrades oil spills and then kills itself could be a great tool for treating this kind of contamination, but having this potential option to solve this kind of problem could allow the incorrect treatment of oil spills and even the loss of its  importance if one occurs, just because there's a tool to solve it. This is just one example of many scenarios that can happen if the system is implemented in an incorrect way; it is possible to prevent this by establishing standardized protocols of use, promote information about the correct operation mode of these type of systems and explain that the special qualities of a technology are for help and improve society not for abuse of it. Communication, moral, awareness and follow-up of the system’s implementation are key for the prevention of this issue. We took it upon ourselves to analyze risks in an integral perspective, with the Next-Level Biosecurity: Dual Use Research of Concern Workshop organized by iGEM.

                                Regulations for the use and application of synthetic biology ideas is completely
                                necessary. New tools and projects are in constant development, and their regulation is
                                usually right behind, affecting their implementation and development. Regulations are
                                established to ensure safety to the population and prevent any risk that can be caused
                                by a synthetic biology system. However, due to the increase and expansion of science
                                nowadays, regulations for more complex projects with great objectives are lagging behind
                                due to ambiguity, bureaucracy and even the case-by-case studies required in most cases.
                                For example the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which was signed and applied by the
                                international community in 2003 for the regulation of modified organisms across
                                countries and allowed the expansion of use of modified organisms, but its incorporation
                                to national legislation varies. Costa Rica’s being determined by political aspects as
                                explained in {Human Practices-Shipping & Policy}. Additionally, for a specific project
                                or idea it is necessary to evaluate the technology used for the development of the
                                product because the regulations also depend on it. Besides that, each country decides
                                the necessary studies and analysis that have to be done for proposing regulations, in
                                which socioeconomic and sociopolitical aspects are considered depending on the focus.
                                For the effective regulation and approval of novel technologies, developers need to
                                communicate closely with regulators, get involved in their work and give as much support
                                as possible, since without legislation, production and commercialization doesn't exist.
                                It’s crucial to orient the legislation to establish new regulations as needed, but it’s
                                also important to promote the process and development to keep improving in different
                                areas hand in hand with regulations that can enable a real implementation of synthetic
                                biology systems. The generation of new data is required to evaluate the products and
                                optimize its regulation, and furthermore it’s necessary to fight for the accessibility
                                of the technology, not only its development. For this and more aspects, the legislation
                                needs to be constantly reviewed in order to continue expanding the implementation
                                possibilities for great technologies.

                                To analyze and define our potential end users we choose four main stakeholder areas that
                                have a direct relationship with the proposed applications mentioned above. First we
                                selected industrial stakeholders that incorporate food and agricultural producers,
                                industry owners and multinational companies. Industry has great implementation potential
                                due to their daily activities and functions of constant development. Next, we selected
                                bioremediation stakeholders that include bioremediation companies and environmentally
                                focused non-governmental organizations. Bioremediation methodologies are always in
                                expansion to fight contamination, thus our suicide circuit has potential to be
                                incorporated into new approaches of bioremediation techniques. Subsequently we chose
                                biomedical stakeholders that include the pharmaceutical industry and private biomedical
                                companies. The improvement of medical areas is expanding hand in hand with synthetic
                                biology technologies due to this aspect, our circuit could be very useful for an
                                implementation in biomedical aspects and its users. Finally, we pick governmental
                                stakeholders: national biotechnology laboratories, state universities and national
                                ministries are part of this section. Governmental users have the power to start applying
                                our system in a real way, empower its development and could help us exceed limitations
                                for the implementation of the circuit.

                                We made a stakeholder map as well, using the virtual tool “iGEMers Guide to the Future”
                                (https://live.flatland.agency/12290417/rathenau-igem/) developed by a collaboration

                                SYNENERGENE. In this map we see our chosen stakeholders in a graph in which the x-axis
                                means the interest of the stakeholder in our project and the y-axis means the power of
                                the stakeholder to influence our project in a positive or negative way.

                                By making the stakeholder map and the analysis behind it, we obtain that a great option
                                to start the implementation of our circuit would be in state universities. State
                                universities could have a great interest in the system, we discussed the project with
                                several experts from state universities and saw a relevant use for the circuit. This
                                could also have a big impact and influence for our project due to its validation as
                                approved by relevant entities, hence opening many doors for us. On the other hand,
                                multinational companies and industry owners may perhaps not be as interested in the
                                system due its complexity and, in a generalized way, they may not understand the utility
                                of the circuit. Thus, if we expect to implement our circuit with these stakeholders,
                                very effective communication must be prepared, along with the specification of benefits
                                that they would obtain when working with this. Optimization of the system for specific
                                applications would also be very valuable for these types of stakeholders. Policy makers
                                who regulate the implementation of our proposal are another critical group with whom
                                dialogue should be pursued when possible; the more involved the developer is, the less
                                likely things are to go sideways. Other groups, such as environmental activists could
                                even display a strong position against the release and use of engineered organisms,
                                given the uncertainty of the consequences it has. Work should be done with both
                                stakeholders in order to include them into the development process, optimizing the
                                project and creating the right conditions for its carrying out.

                            <p class="">
                                We mentioned above that our circuit could be implemented in different areas of research
                                in a very useful way, but how could this have a real repercussion in the scientific
                                community? With our circuit we aim to solve scientists’ problems, enabling them to keep
                                improving society. As a tool, our construct can be used to start working on areas that
                                have not been completely addressed so far, like complex environments. We also want to
                                focus the perspective about the use and release of engineered organisms, they have great
                                potential of use but due to concerns and regulations the applicability is limited. We
                                expect to have an impact across the scientific community because with our circuit we can
                                open many doors in this scope, explore new possibilities and approaches in a novel form
                                that has not been done before.

                                Hand in hand with experts feedback, we also aim to implement our suicide circuit into
                                new development areas and for advanced applications to keep expanting the applicabiliy
                                of synthetic biology. First of all, the bioelectronics field, with our system, could be
                                possible to generate or eliminate potential charges after the expected death of the
                                organism, this for the controlled construction of biocircuits. Our circuit could be
                                useful for the generation of synthetic extracellular matrices for the synthesis of
                                specific metabolites and then expect cell death, to only adquiere the molecules of
                                interest and eliminate any background interference compound. It could also be applicable
                                to study events that are difficult to define like the determination of cytotoxicity,
                                circadian cycles, planned obsolescence, oscillation frequencies, the quantification of
                                bacterial proliferation and bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Plant varieties could
                                also be developed and agriculture could be improved by adding bacteria that promote
                                plant growth and don't generate metabolic issues.

                                We made a future snapshots analysis to anticipate the utility and implementation of our
                                circuit in a hypothetical future basing ourselves on the fact that our system was
                                completely accepted into society, since we believe that although it may pose some
                                concerns initially, slowly it will become accepted. First, we visualize an increase in
                                different applications based on the use of engineering organisms with limited life. One
                                of the conferences we attended even proposed that a whole industry would probably be
                                built out of different organism liberation methods. We think that our system will be
                                completely characterized and optimized as a tool that can be implemented to any idea or
                                project. We consider that regulations about synthetic biology and the use of engineered
                                organisms may be changed to establish aspects about the correct use of systems like
                                ours. Finally, we want to be an inspiration to the scientific community and further
                                projects that aim to keep improving synthetic biology and the society itself.

                                        State machines are based on sequential logic, they respond to specific inputs to
                                        perform a certain output depending on the state of the system and the inputs
                                        history. In these types of systems, the architecture conformation of the machine
                                        is crucial for the response across different types of inputs; a same input can
                                        cause a completely different result depending on the state of the system. State
                                        machines are applicable to biological systems due to their flexibility, time
                                        response and memory, and can enable a whole new perspective of development for
                                        synthetic biology applications. Nevertheless, sequential logic is just beginning
                                        to be applied to biology, the construction of genetic circuits and the
                                        conceptualization of complex systems. For it to be implemented, the main
                                        requirements are a change of point of view and methodology of resolution.
                                        Visualizing cellular constructs and genetic circuits as state machines enables a
                                        different line of thinking to solve complex problems with novel, more efficient,
                                        solutions, yielding great opportunities of implementation in synthetic biology.

                                        When we started to explore sequential logic to apply it to the project, we
                                        encountered a lot of possibilities and decided to make available this
                                        perspective in order to expand the use of these types of systems. The
                                        development of our framework and software arised from the utility that
                                        sequential logic based systems can confer to synthetic biology, given the
                                        virtually unexplored opportunities granted by the similarities between
                                        biological systems and state machines. With our {framework} we aimed to
                                        facilitate and guide the performance of complex biological tasks; as well to
                                        implement it in a real way as a tool for modular simulation and analysis.
                                        <br><br> We designed our framework and software to make a tool that can guide,
                                        construct and assess diverse types of synthetic genetic circuits according to
                                        the user's wants and needs. Our inspiration was based on creating a general and
                                        modular system for the exploration of sequential logic based synthetic biology
                                        to benefit experts and scientists with different types of knowledge, in a novel
                                        way that can be applicable in many fields of action.
                                        <br><br> Sequential logic gives a new perspective for the resolution of complex
                                        scenarios and we want to take advantage of its characteristics to give the
                                        scientific community a novel tool based on this mindset. During our user
                                        interviews one of the interviewees even told us that she understood where we
                                        were going when we had only explained sequential logic in theory. With our
                                        framework the user can establish the conditions for different situations to
                                        occur in each specific state of action, this increases the generation of results
                                        and data of parameters of interest according to the application and visualizes
                                        their affectations on the overall model.

                                        Frameworks, algorithms, software and databases for the construction and
                                        development of genetic circuits have been made across the years, but most of
                                        these projects and ideas are based on combinatorial logic. In a combinatorial
                                        logic system the output only depends on the present input; the state of the
                                        system is not relevant because the response is only mediated by the activation
                                        signal. This contrasts with sequential logic, where the state of the system
                                        affects the whole behavior and response of the system. We establish a conceptual
                                        framework based on sequential logic to construct and apply genetic circuits in
                                        the most efficient way according to the users wants and needs. This type of
                                        framework enables an efficient and modular approach to tackle sequentially
                                        dependent biological tasks. Additionally, developing a framework software allows
                                        the direct implementation of the conceptual framework, in which its
                                        characteristics such as its structure and behavior can be applied. The structure
                                        of the software gives the user a set of parts that can be incorporated into the
                                        system to provide specific organization of action to resolve the expected
                                        function; its behavior is validated through the interactions and functions of
                                        the parts with other biological elements inside the system to generate results
                                        and data of the expected genetic circuit. In addition, through its database we
                                        have the possibility to store the constructs from the software, making them
                                        easily available to be assessed by different kinds of users. To know more about

                                        To better understand sequential logic and our framework, founded upon it, we
                                        want to first make an emphasis on how sequential logic can be applied and
                                        implemented to solve complex problems. Sequential logic allows us to visualize
                                        situations beyond input-output systems, due to the importance of the state. With
                                        sequential logic, the same input can cause a different output depending on the
                                        conformation of the system, like in biological processes. In biological systems,
                                        state is crucial for its function, interactions and development. Genetic
                                        expression and interaction with a substrate or even apoptosis are processes in
                                        which the same signal can induce a completely new behavior depending on the
                                        current state of the parts and the other elements that interact in the system.
                                        This is why sequential logic can be perfectly applied into biological circuits.
                                        By understanding this we can see a problem as a state machine, depending on the
                                        situation and specific moment. To solve it, optimizing and characterizing
                                        multiple scenarios of action between selected parts and the construct itself can
                                        be carried out. Having this mindset when we face a complex system or problems
                                        allows us to think in multiple ways to settle a solution if we see it as
                                        subsequent steps or decisions, giving sequential logic an authentic utility in
                                        the real world.

                                        An open access or open source software is a type of modality in which a

                                        confers a more public application for the use and development of the software
                                        according to the user requirements; hence, we aim to apply this access type to
                                        our software. Normally the distribution, change, and application of the software
                                        is exclusive to the people that have the copyrights of the system, but with the
                                        open license all these characteristics are public for the users, for any use and
                                        purpose. Since our goal is to expand information, case studies, examples
                                        regarding our system, and, more importantly, validate its relevance, making it
                                        open access is a way to enable the accomplishment of this goal through the
                                        real-life implementation of our software. Additionally, it’s a way to enable the
                                        users to continue expanding and optimizing the software itself. If the system
                                        wasn’t made available via open access license, its modularity and implementation
                                        would be hindered and limited for the users, which goes against our purpose and
                                        beliefs. We aim to create a format of operation that constantly increases all
                                        kinds of possibilities of use, and, under the implementation of open access

                                Our framework enables the possibility to solve conceptual issues across the scientific
                                community based on sequential logic steps. The qualities and characteristics of our
                                framework could help the improvement of emerging ideas and existing mechanisms by giving
                                a new perspective of action for the solution of complex problems. Based on experts
                                feedback, literature and iGEM project proposals we choose four areas to visualize the

                                        Polluted environments are normally contaminated with multiple toxic molecules,
                                        such as: pesticides, heavy metals and dangerous chemical compounds, generating a
                                        complex situation to remediate. Bioremediation on an uncontrolled system as a
                                        river or soil is difficult because every compound (either toxic or not) can
                                        affect the biological diversity and physicochemical properties of the
                                        environment. With our framework and visualizing this issue as a state machine,
                                        we can establish a solution model based on the bioremediation of specific
                                        compounds in certain timeframes to reduce the changes in the uncontrolled system
                                        and effectuate the remediation job in a more efficient way. It is also possible
                                        to construct a mechanism in only one chassis organism that could contain all the
                                        bioremediation system, without necessarily expressing it all at once, having the
                                        advantages of reducing costs and making the methodology simpler. Our framework
                                        could improve projects by simplifying their circuits, for example iGEM Hong
                                        Kong-City U 2020 aimed to make engineered bacteria that secrete multiple
                                        degradation enzymes to improve and make more efficient the plastic waste
                                        pollution. With sequential logic we can construct a system that expresses
                                        different degradation enzymes depending on the substrate and the specific
                                        moment. We talked to experts for feedback regarding the impact of sequential
                                        logic in bioremediation; Ing. Johan Morales Sánchez and Lic. Rossy Guillén
                                        Watson suggested that our system could be useful for waste-water treatment and
                                        for antibiotic traceability under different conditions. In addition, Lic.
                                        Victoria Zamora and Lic. Juan Carlos Hernández mentioned that bioremediation of
                                        multiple substances according to the present stimuli, environment and followed
                                        pathway could allow a remediation in the correct order to maintain balance and
                                        execute the task efficiently.

                                        Diseases cause multiple metabolic and physiological reactions in the organism.
                                        If we visualize a disease as a state machine that changes through time with the
                                        biological responses of the organism, we can apply our framework to treat
                                        specific diseases in a more accurate way. Sequential logic allows us to treat
                                        diseases as a step by step issue, hence several solution pathways can be
                                        explored based on the state of development of the disease. Sequential logic
                                        could even aid the determination of a disease’s state, avoiding the use of
                                        invasive methodologies and improving the biomedicine field using sequential
                                        logic and synthetic biology. Our framework could also improve ideas and projects
                                        in the biomedical field like iGEM Nottingham 2020’s project. They aimed to make
                                        a biotherapeutic strain of Clostridium sporogenes to prevent, detect and treat
                                        neurodegeneration in patients. With our framework we can propose a system to
                                        know the state of neurodegeneration and make a personalized treatment depending
                                        on the development of the disease, complementing the iGEM Nottingham 2020 idea.
                                        When discussing this issue with experts they saw a relevant applicability of our
                                        framework to biomedicine and therapeutic aspects. Lic. Kendall Alfaro Jiménez
                                        and PhD. Carolina Centeno Cerdas suggested that our system could be useful to
                                        know when it’s necessary to change a treatment, such as chemotherapy or
                                        immunotherapy, and to establish diseases as a state machine in order to develop
                                        decision pathways to treat a certain sickness according to its real progression.
                                        Additionally, Ph.D. Candidate Kattia Nuñez Montero and PhD. Rodrigo Mora
                                        Rodríguez mentioned that with this system it would be possible to exchange a
                                        bacteria consortia to a single bacteria with multiple sequential capabilities,
                                        to develop an excellent screening system for different behaviors or pathways,
                                        and circuits that respond to different stimuli and follow diverse routes
                                        depending on the specific interest. This could help with diseases with inherent
                                        heterogeneity, such as cancer, allowing the exclusion of normal cells while
                                        covering the different subpopulations. Also, activating the therapy under
                                        specific conditions improves its specificity. These could be possible
                                        applications for the development of our framework in the biomedical and
                                        therapeutics field.

                                        Every product of an industrial process needs to follow certain steps or states

                                        the industry to optimize the paths followed for production according to specific
                                        requirements, products, methods and user needs. It could be possible to explore
                                        different pathways to produce a specific product and determine which pathway is
                                        the more efficient one. This could be achieved by making decision patterns that
                                        reduce metabolic burden while using metabolic engineering to reduce costs and
                                        improve methodologies of production and develop new mechanisms for the synthesis
                                        of certain compounds that are too complex or too expensive to produce. Our
                                        framework could be applied to characterize new methodologies and mechanisms of
                                        production, like the project from iGEM BIT-China 2020. Their idea was focused on
                                        the production of a co-culture of E.coli and S.cerevisiae to improve the
                                        fermentation industry of a specific vegetal compound (eriodictyol) with medical
                                        value. Our framework could be implemented to optimize the functionality of the
                                        system for the effective production of this molecule by establishing more
                                        efficient pathways of development and selecting the desired characteristics to
                                        applied into the circuit. Experts also told us that our framework could be
                                        really useful for industrial processes; PhD. Monserrat Jarquín Cordero, PhD.
                                        Pablo Jiménez Bonilla and PhD. Stefany Solano González suggested that our system
                                        could be functional for studying different pathways in just one circuit,
                                        determining the interaction of specific synthetic compounds with its
                                        sub-products, inducing production after a certain time and for verifying the
                                        functionality of a specific process. In addition, Bach. Laura Chaves Martínez,
                                        Ph.D. Candidate Olman Gómez Espinoza and M.Ed. Carolina Sancho Blanco mentioned
                                        that the formulation and development of nanoparticles, opening a path and
                                        segmentation for large scale metabolic engineering and determining the
                                        production and interaction of an expected product with its subproducts are
                                        potential applications for our system across the industry.

                                        Biosensors are based on detecting specific responses or compounds, therefore
                                        they report a certain signal. Biosensors follow certain steps to make a
                                        response, acting like state machines, and with our framework it is possible to
                                        improve the biosensing mechanism and its development using sequential logic. Our
                                        framework could allow the construction of complex biosensors that detect
                                        multiple compounds in a specific order by exploring different detection
                                        mechanisms in only one circuit. It also could enable the recognition and
                                        determination of the interaction between different target molecules by
                                        evaluating its functionality in certain conditions and optimizing parameters.
                                        Also, our framework could improve proposed biosensor ideas like iGEM
                                        DeNovocastrians 2020. Their biosensor was focused on detecting, importing and
                                        degrading the petrochemical benzene in the natural environment. With our
                                        framework it's possible to establish different pathways of response depending on
                                        the conformation of the target molecule and the state of the biosensor.
                                        Additionally, Ph.D. Candidate Olman Gómez Espinoza and Lic. Juan Carlos
                                        Hernández told us that our system is useful to study different degradation
                                        pathways and for allocating resources or changing qualities for periods of time
                                        while maintaining balance in a complex environment.

                                environmentally focused non-governmental organizations. The same principles apply to
                                bioremediation companies and biomedical stakeholders including the pharmaceutical
                                industry. We picked gubernamental stakeholders: national biotechnology laboratories,
                                public universities and national ministries. Gubernamental users have the power to start
                                applying our system in a real setting . This would help us to introduce the
                                implementation of the framework and software to start employing it as a new tool for the
                                resolution of complex scenarios. Computation and bioinformatics users as well as
                                researchers focused on investigation are important groups to consider for the
                                introduction of the conceptual framework and software framework. Due to the
                                computational understanding of these groups they could see a pioneering idea to expand
                                this field of action. M. Sc. Raúl Trejos Espinoza mentioned to us that doing this
                                project is great and a big challenge itself and can be a foundational work for projects
                                and similar systems to come. In addition to this, companies that focus on the
                                development of softwares and computational systems may be interested in our system in
                                order to expand its catalogue and generate similar frameworks and softwares for
                                different uses. On the other hand, policy makers who regulate the application of our
                                technology are a crucial group to dialogue with due to the all potential applications
                                that our system could be involved with. It's necessary to include these stakeholders to
                                establish the correct development, regulations and conditions for the expected
                                implementation of the project.

                                By making the stakeholder map and its analysis, we find that a great option to begin the
                                implementation of our framework and software would be in collaboration with
                                computational-bioinformatics experts and software companies. These stakeholders have the
                                learning, experience, tools and interest to start applying the framework and software
                                into test studies, new developments and even products. When the implementation of the
                                system has been more structured, we aim to focus on the industry stakeholders. Our
                                system could be easily adapted into industrial applications to diminish costs of
                                production and for optimizing complex fabrication processes. For biomedical and
                                bioremediation stakeholders, we expect to work with them when we expand data and results
                                of our framework-software into the database, at that moment we expect to already have
                                protocols, guides and models for different uses to start applying it into new models of
                                resolution in these areas. For the regulation aspects, we aim to discuss with the policy
                                makers to show them the functionality and applicability of our system to create the
                                correct development route and conditions of use of the framework-software hand to hand
                                with them. Actions have to be taken to guide the expected proposal of implementation for
                                our system, but with dialogue between the different groups of stakeholders it should be
                                possible to start including our technology within the real world. But in its first stage
                                of introduction we aim to highlight the utility and applicability of the system to
                                target groups to start developing the full potential of the conceptual framework and
                                software framework.

                                In the same way as our suicide circuit, we want the framework-software to have a real
                                repercussion across the scientific community. Due to its capacities and fields of
                                application mentioned above, we really see that our framework-software has the potential
                                to be a novel and great tool that could expand the toolbox of the scientific community.
                                This system can open many doors across the scientific community to make the construction
                                of genetic circuits more practical, efficient and accurate. We expect that in its most
                                structured form the software will be applied in any field of interest, to add another
                                option in the workflow for the resolution of complex problems besides combinatorial
                                logic based systems. Hopefully we expand the use of sequential logic based systems to
                                explore new mechanisms, possibilities and emerging ideas that can be achieved by
                                frameworks, softwares and circuits like ours.

                                To further explore more possibilities and options for our software framework, in
                                addition with expert feedback, our software could be applied to gene-regulatory
                                applications, enabling the determination of necessary gene expression, along with its
                                time frame, for specific tasks. The software framework and sequential logic could be
                                useful in the metabolomics area by having the possibility to explore different
                                biosynthetic routes in a biochemical model and obtain information about certain
                                metabolic processes. Additionally, multiple pathways and test studies could be
                                incorporated in just one transformation process and, depending on specific inputs and
                                the order in which they’re applied, the response (gene expression) could have endless
                                variations. Other potential applications for the software framework could be
                                evolutionary studies developed from the tracking of evolutionary trajectories by single
                                cell sequentiation; it could also be possible to differentially tag cells depending on
                                the state of the system according to PhD. Pablo Bolaños and PhD. Rodrigo Mora.

                                For our framework and software we made a future snapshots analysis to preview the use
                                and application of our system in a hypothetical future in which the technology is
                                completely implemented. First, for our conceptual framework we expect the development of
                                higher levels of specificity of its use and expand its approach to more complex
                                biological systems. We visualize it as a standardized tool, an option that becomes part
                                of the established mechanisms for the resolution of target problems. Furthermore, we
                                expect an expansion in the use examples for each application area and case studies
                                regarding the user requirements for its most efficient use. In addition, we want the
                                conceptual framework to be a guide that enables the use and comparison between different
                                potential frameworks to come, to obtain the correct perspective of the solution to
                                target a complex problem. For our software framework we anticipate the use and extension
                                of the generated library where the users consult it for a wide range of applications and
                                include their data. We visualize the tool to be contemplated inside the basic toolbox
                                for the analysis of these challenging scenarios; and to be linked to databases and more
                                analysis tools for a bigger capacity of assessment in specific cases. Moreover, we look
                                forward to the optimization of the software framework for cluster processing, that
                                includes its code licensing to standardize the criteria and parameters for the
                                evaluation of genetic circuits. The implementation of more complex analysis filters
                                could be developed to expand inclusive more the applications of the system. We want to
                                make an impact in coming projects and ideas to improve the scientific community and
                                society.

                                    The search for ways to mitigate the impact of man on the planet, to repay it the
                                    benefits that has given to us as growing professionals and human beings or simply to
                                    try to find solutions based on what it is already around us, is part of the task in
                                    which not only dedicated or enthusiastic scientists should be involved, but it must
                                    be a whole network of circular support. Environmental and moral concerns should be
                                    involved from the process of having an idea, making this idea a creation, to each of
                                    its ramifications and resulting coincidences.
                                    <br><br> Through this process of ethical evaluation, we do not intend to just write
                                    it down on paper, but to ensure that it is put into practice and serve as a
                                    reference for those projects that involve genetic modification systems and their
                                    biocontainment methods.
                                    <br> As a starting point, we consider the concept of biosafety mentioned by Munshi &
                                    Sharma (2018) which described it “as an asset of actions or concerns to minimize or
                                    erase the potential risks to environment or living beings derived from development,
                                    implementation, or commercialization of biotechnology or bioengineering or to
                                    counteract the negative impact of these two fields”.
                                    <br> On the basis of the above-mentioned concept, our main values considered in
                                    order to cover all the potential risks and keep them in mind are: <b>integrity,
                                        responsibility, balance, accountability, commitment, perseverance and
                                        innovation</b>; all of them with the intention of having under control not only
                                    the specific project parts and their interactions but also the whole range of
                                    applications, as seen on the {implementation} section. The possibilities are not
                                    limited for the users applications. It’s also our responsibility to make sure we are
                                    giving them a safe and assessed result that has previous confirmation of the
                                    development process step by step by multiple and highly prepared professionals.

                                    <br><br> It can be difficult to validate the idea of a project whose technical basis
                                    is not only a specific area, in this case synthetic biology, but other complements
                                    such as our framework and circuit, that function as tools and whose specific
                                    application has not yet been elucidated. Nonetheless, it’s important to submit all
                                    projects to a rigorous evaluation of the implications of this interaction of
                                    elements for the environment and its impact on society. The elaboration of a risk
                                    assessment, as detailed in the {implementation} section, is essential to achieve an
                                    integral project.
                                    <br> In addition, as a foundational advance project, the elaboration of a good
                                    assessment is complicated, since it involves a balance between looking profoundly
                                    into the tools and their possible applications and impact, without biasing or
                                    limiting their application. A great tool is both made by its wide range and its
                                    effectiveness when applied to specific issues. However, to have a truly valuable
                                    tool, it’s not its creator who determines this value, but its prospective users.
                                    This is why we went to them to evaluate our tool, orient it towards their actual
                                    needs, and optimize it accordingly. With these interviews we also wanted to
                                    demonstrate that fresh ideas from competent professionals can have a significant
                                    contribution to the development of the project, even when in opposition to the
                                    initial proposals. The real enrichment is about finding convergences between
                                    differences.

                                <p class="">
                                    Genetically engineered organisms, despite their many advantages, continue to be
                                    regarded as threatening to human and environmental health, as uncontrolled
                                    modification and development of specifically constructed gene assemblies by using
                                    advanced techniques has meant continuous disagreement (Munshi & Sharma, 2018).
                                    That is why, together with the iGEM MSU team, we believe that it is essential to
                                    facilitate discussion and evaluation spaces for biocontainment systems and other
                                    relevant safety-related subjects of interest for the participating iGEM teams. You
                                    can take a look at the explanation of the activity in the {Collaborations} section.
                                    <br><br> At the round table, the teams agreed that from the moment the idea was
                                    conceived, it’s really necessary to assess if implementing synthetic biology is the
                                    best method to solve a problem or if there are better alternatives that do not
                                    require complex systems, given the risk regarding the release release of synthetic,
                                    possibly detrimental, genetic material and organisms to the environment.
                                    Concern was raised about current biocontainment techniques; including evaluation of
                                    chassis type, metabolic burden efficiency, mutations, homologous gene transfer,
                                    whether it is better to implement a physical or biological retention and even if
                                    there really should be biocontainment, considering that synbio will always be
                                    interacting with the environment in some way.
                                    <br><br> Regardless of which organism you are working with inside or outside iGEM,
                                    there is no excuse not to consider the biosafety of genetically engineered
                                    organisms. This is necessary in order to avoid the project being considered an
                                    irresponsible or lacking of scientific justification, and to prevent pressure
                                    campaigns and opponents to synthetic biology, which would imply a regression to the
                                    progress achieved to date (Christiansen, 2016).
                                    Ensuring that there is an efficient and effective way to limit the metabolism,
                                    development, mobility, life in general of a micro-organism or in general the
                                    retention and removal of human-modified genetic fragments, allow for greater
                                    credibility and a better image of what is being done in synthetic biology. In this
                                    way, we are hoping for a better reception of the tools and products generated, which
                                    ultimately are expected to be new solutions which, in contrast to existing ones,
                                    will be more beneficial in their use and impact on the environment and society.
                                    <br><br> At the beginning we thought of conducting a round of surveys to probe the
                                    perception of the development, use and regulation of genetically modified organisms
                                    in Costa Rica; however, because it is advisable to have an adequate sample in terms
                                    of its characteristics and number, and because of the virtuality of the moment, it
                                    was difficult to contact people beyond the academic environment of those who
                                    participate in the team. We instead decided to focus our efforts on analyzing
                                    synthetic biology from a social perspective along with other considerations such as
                                    science communication that we believe should be raised by the rest of the iGEM teams
                                    in their projects. To learn more about synthetic biology’s questions about the

                                <p class="">
                                    This bidirectional exchange with the social sciences students of University of Costa
                                    Rica (UCR), turned into something that, although not usually considered with the
                                    deserved relevance, demonstrates the weight of these considerations and the impact
                                    it can have on what synthetic biologists develop. Particularly in the way in which
                                    it can be received by others, because the results should, after all, be oriented
                                    towards their usefulness, impact and benefits for society and the environment. <br>



                                    Within the conversation certain counterpoints for the synbio community were
                                    shown. These are not capricious demands, on the contrary, they managed to evaluate
                                    our own criteria as a team with respect to what we have learned before and during
                                    the competition. Some of the highlights collected are shown below:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li> It is fundamental to </b>question the interests that are pursued with the
                                            development of our project</b> and if it will really get where it is needed,
                                            since
                                            it is not new that many of the scientific and technological developments
                                            have a
                                            tendency to lean mainly for political and economic reasons.</li>


                                        <li> The fact that </b>humans have had a dominant role over nature</b> was put
                                            on the balance, including its alteration and grabbing of resources without
                                            looking
                                            to pay its debt to the environment despite the pressures of climate change,
                                            always
                                            under the justification that it is finally a benefit for the human being. As
                                            scientists we must avoid being and portraying ourselves as ecological
                                            imperialism
                                            and extractivism supporters at all cost.</li>


                                        <li> </b>Policy often tends to manipulate environmental issues to leave
                                            benefits in the hands of very few</b>, promoting an imbalance and bringing
                                            down the
                                            sustainable development that is desirable. The political classes, in order
                                            to win
                                            the favoritism of the population, take advantage to sell themselves as
                                            supporters of
                                            the green movements, making the real environmental initiatives lose
                                            credibility when
                                            they really do seek to support and strengthen bioethics.</li>


                                        <li> Sometimes </b>the problem appears to be solved</b>, but it is vital to
                                            ensure that the resolution of that problem isn’t just that it becomes
                                            someone
                                            else's, thus becoming a cyclical and time-consuming </b>"export of the
                                            problem"</b>,
                                            which tends to fall on countries or sectors that are unlikely to have the
                                            resources
                                            to mitigate its the impact.</li>


                                        <li> </b>Science should always comply with ethical and moral commitments, but
                                            it should also seek a socio-political commitment</b>, since science is
                                            governed by
                                            the supply and demand dictated by the needs of the population and its own
                                            values. We
                                            should keep in mind that </b>decisions take power in the hands of the
                                            people</b> if
                                            there is adequate communication, proper accountability and dissemination of
                                            the
                                            information that they should know to make responsible choices.
                                            Misinformation
                                            generates contagious rejection, whereas well-founded opinion generates
                                            responsible
                                            criteria construction on individuals.</li>


                                        <li> It is of major importance </b>to change the negative connotation of the
                                            term "transgenic"</b>, since what we want to avoid is the pressure to
                                            disguise that
                                            perception either by using false information or by omission of details that
                                            can be
                                            decisive for its approval or rejection by society. That is why they
                                            proposed, as an
                                            ideal situation, </b>the investment in the primary education of children</b>
                                            to
                                            build adults, whose new, broader and more informed perspective modify social
                                            structure and roles to achieve the proper development of the sciences
                                            applied to
                                            real life.</li>

                                        <li> </b>If we want to educate on topics such as synthetic biology or
                                            biotechnology in general, we must first ensure that everyone is being
                                            educated</b>
                                            without leaving out those who have had fewer opportunities. The
                                            universalization of
                                            education, the reduction of social gaps and inequality are key points for
                                            the
                                            </b>formation of the activist spirit in the future agents of change</b>.

                                        <li> In retrospect, thanks to this dialogue we understood that synbio depends on
                                            people in a holistic way, and that, consequently, a problem is </b>not truly

                                <p class="">
                                    As young people in science, we are committed to being agents of change and that is
                                    why we decided to participate in the initiative of the iGEM Patras team, activity
                                    detailed in the {Collaborations} section.


                                    <br><br> As a team we chose four main initial sustainable development goals to work
                                    with and established for each one a vision of what we hope to accomplish during the
                                    development of the project and that is reflected in its expected implementation by
                                    other teams in the future:

                                        <li> </b>Good health and wellbeing</b>: as mentioned by some of the experts
                                            consulted, our circuit could be used in areas as biomedicine that includes
                                            the
                                            pharmaceutical industry and private biomedical companies. As examples: our
                                            framework
                                            could be useful to treat specific diseases in a more accurate way, the
                                            sequential
                                            logic implemented could determine a disease’s state, avoiding the use of
                                            invasive
                                            methods, and the whole system could help to indicate when it’s necessary to
                                            change a
                                            treatment, such as chemotherapy or immunotherapy, also allowing to establish
                                            diseases as a state machine in order to develop decision pathways to treat
                                            more
                                            efficiently a certain sickness based on its progression. All of them thought
                                            with
                                            the objective to save valuable time and lives.</li>


                                        <li> </b>Clean water and sanitation</b>: some consulted experts noted that
                                            our circuit has potential in water treatment techniques and environmental
                                            assays.
                                            From the beginning, our project was conceived by our team as useful for
                                            bioremediation applications, because we know that water is a valuable and
                                            limited
                                            resource and even more so in developing countries like ours. Hence, a system
                                            like
                                            ours, which contemplates biocontainment, is the minimum expected if someone
                                            wants to
                                            work with synthetic biology and be responsible towards health and the
                                            environment at
                                            the same time.</li>


                                        <li> </b>Responsible consumption and production</b>: as told by some experts,
                                            this system could also be a highly useful industrial tool and that, with our
                                            framework, the industry procedures could be optimized according to the
                                            users’ needs.
                                            The exploration of different pathways would potentialize the production of
                                            specific
                                            compounds by determining the most efficient routes and applying metabolic
                                            engineering to reduce costs and improve methodologies of production,
                                            therefore
                                            reducing the number of toxic reagents and resources, such as water, needed
                                            by
                                            production. This would make the final products more sustainable and, when
                                            applying
                                            sequential logic, even make available the opportunity for circular
                                            processes.
                                            Nevertheless, the most important part is that our counter circuit enables
                                            the
                                            autonomous time management of our engineered bacteria, making the
                                            kill-switch
                                            independent from environmental conditions. The way this mechanism could be
                                            so
                                            independent is both an advantage and a potential risk because biology and
                                            human
                                            interest are uncertain, a fact we have been aware of throughout the process
                                            and been
                                            keen to contemplate as much as possible in our project.</li>


                                        <li> </b>Partnerships for the goals</b>: our team, as many others in iGEM,
                                            reflect the necessity for interdisciplinarity and cooperation to achieve not
                                            only
                                            the completion of a project but for it to be as optimal and functional as
                                            possible.
                                            We strongly believe that, as society, we need the integration of different
                                            points of
                                            view to be considered as true game changers on the proposal of solutions
                                            that push
                                            for change in the country’s policies and laws and in society itself. In
                                            parallel,
                                            encouraging communication between the scientific and non-scientific
                                            communities is
                                            key to convert strategies into more than just a bait to be well perceived by
                                            the
                                            general public, government or other countries and also to demonstrate that
                                            there is
                                            a bidirectional relationship between society, policy and development, making
                                            it
                                            relevant for everyone to have the basic knowledge necessary to make

                <p class="">
                    Synthetic biology has the potential to have a high impact on the development of solutions to
                    problems that already exist or have not yet come to light. That’s why, like any valuable tool, it
                    needs to be protected and handled responsibly. This is achieved effectively only if there is a good
                    communication process between those who understand its technicalities and those who will be directly
                    or indirectly involved in its manipulation, use or understanding of it in order to achieve a good
                    transfer of knowledge with society.
                    <br><br> We consulted several experts, in the quality of potential users, for a realistic evaluation
                    of our tool’s value and its efficiency at targeting their needs. The professionals consulted in
                    meetings with a duration between one and two hours, really broke the expected scheme in the best of
                    ways, as they drastically changed the vision of all areas of the project, in a technical and social
                    level, as well as the direction to which it should be oriented in order to be a tool with real use,
                    applicability and impact. They looked far and beyond the ideal of doing something unique and
                    changing the world all the way to its real impact in practical scenarios.
                    <br><br> The meetings per se involved our presenting of the tools without hinting at their possible
                    applications, which was particularly enriching since we made a point of assembling experts with
                    different backgrounds and perspectives. Our presentation skills and storytelling improved along the
                    way, allowing us to have more daunting meetings and making better follow-up questions to their
                    inputs. Hence, each meeting was more enriching than the last, allowing us to slowly cover all the
                    gaps in our project and expand the possibilities for its implementation.
                    <br><br> The main questions made were about what kind of changes would they change and what kind of
                    applications do they suggest. Below, the potential users and their feedback:

                    Costa Rica, despite being considered a green and environmentally committed country in search of
                    I+D+I (Investigation, Development and Innovation), has evolved slowly, and even adversely, compared
                    to other countries that have felt pressure not only on their natural resources, but also on their
                    economic, scientific and technological resources. For this reason and motivation of the Shipping
                    Policies Collaboration by After iGEM, we decided to talk directly with 10 professionals with
                    different profiles in the range of researchers to entrepreneurs in the biotechnology area, who have
                    had to deal with different impediments to their work; such as:

                                    At first we thought of making a guide for making decisions before possible scenarios
                                    both related to the request of permits and to the orders of reagents, inputs,
                                    strains and genetic parts, whose usual national or international request imply a
                                    great delay in research or specific suppliers and therefore, economic losses or
                                    other repercussions to projects. However, as the areas and procedures to be followed
                                    vary tremendously according to subtle technical differences, we should define it in
                                    the form of a compilation that allows a global view of the national panorama in this
                                    area as a primary step for future consultations.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Gather contacts of interest as administrative staff in customs, investors,
                                            people who may have similar experiences and even from similar areas, lawyers
                                            who understand their rights and related legal terms, among other

                                            promotion.</li>
                                        <li>Verify advantages and disadvantages of being inside or outside a public
                                            institution for the development of a project, and thus weigh in the benefits
                                            of being a part of a public vs private institution for the request for
                                            permits, the import and export of reagents and organisms, the availability
                                            of opportunities and resources and the kind of impression given in specific

                                            avoid projects getting held back because of tardiness in the acquisition of
                                            resources; a very uncommon issue for first world countries who usually have
                                            resources at hand or at least imply less complications in their access.</li>
                                        <li>Staying in constant training on different areas is useful to meet people

                                            country goes about each of them and where one stands in these relationships.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>It is not only necessary to know the relevant laws to do something, it is
                                            also important that people are guided on how to access that information, how
                                            to complete forms and applications, and that the technicalities be explained
                                            to them, because these aspects could be obfuscating for someone who is not
                                            very well informed or has not had a similar experience before, such as when
                                            starting a research project or own entrepreneurship. This should be of
                                            governmental relevance, in order to reduce the tendency to make incorrect
                                            decisions or, in the worst and undesirable cases, abnormal within the law.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Related to the previous point, the training could also be bidirectional.
                                            Young people like us can guide and contribute fresh ideas to the people who
                                            create policies and they can find a space to better understand and discuss
                                            the implications of their decision-making and thus reach a point of
                                            equilibrium on the same page.</li>
                                        <li>There should be spaces and people in charge of clarification of technical
                                            terms and product specifications in both kind of scenarios: in customs
                                            agencies in case a product is solicited and received directly from out of
                                            the country by researchers or entrepreneurs themselves, or if it is done
                                            through intermediaries by mailbox or through the departments in charge of
                                            receiving and delivering supplies at universities or public institutions in
                                            general. This should be a process of coordination between the academy,
                                            industry and the commercial sector mainly.</li>

                                    In addition, together with members of the After iGEM division in charge of shipping
                                    policies guidance, it was possible to establish communication with people involved
                                    in the national and international law development, such as M.Sc. Carolina Peláez,
                                    with whom we had a discussion on national strategies for legislation, concluding
                                    that the current system could lead to purely bureaucratic processes that delay
                                    progress in the development of new technologies like GMOs. This was further asserted
                                    when consulting a Law Student who explained that in Costa Rica the legislation is
                                    unstable, since every year law reforms are made. These tend to be very general,
                                    without really getting into the details that, as professionals in sciences, afflict
                                    us most either for profit or research purposes. This also leaves regulation and
                                    policy making to the institutions who handle these issues, which have little
                                    consistency throughout the years, since their conformation changes every four years
                                    with the presidential elections.
                                    <br><br> A real solution for this issue would be to create a whole new package of
                                    laws based on current problems, as defined by scientists -mainly-, and not making
                                    insignificant article reforms that include enough infractions and prohibitions to
                                    almost ensure that it consumes so much time for us to take action that when finally
                                    finished, they could change them again and invalidate whatever is not longer
                                    applying.
                                    <br><br> The fact that the laws and regulation on biotechnology lack homogeneity and
                                    consistency in our country causes legal insecurity and in some cases instability in
                                    project’s development. Here we compile some laws and regulations of biotechnological
                                    interest in Costa Rica:
                                    <br><br> Having the privilege of participating in international experiences such as
                                    iGEM, receiving quality higher education and at the same time to be first-hand
                                    trained by experts from multiple areas, encouraged us to prevent misinformation from
                                    taking part in unjustified regulations, slow bureaucracy or incongruities of the
                                    laws. We are now called to be agents for change, as advisors and counselors for a
                                    population sample beyond the university environment.

                <p class="">
                    The objective of the involvement with the population and consequent divulgation of synbio, is not to
                    convince people that it is the only way to make something revolutionary, but to make evident the
                    existence of options to solve problems using nature with some additional human help to provide more
                    solutions and bring them closer to those who need them.
                    <br><br> It’s important for people to feel personally involved with biotechnological development, to
                    make scientific communication not just a real two-way feedback enrichment, but also to make the
                    general public feel listened to and encourage their involvement through which responsibility for
                    having an informed opinion can be developed. This can have a profound impact on the science that
                    will propose tomorrow’s solutions, it’s public perception, available resources, and possibilities.
                    <br><br> In the modern world, in which there are so many sources of information, it has a huge
                    importance for people to be targeted not to persuade them to display a blind approval of synthetic
                    biology or acceptance of science as an absolute, but instead to see all the synergies that are
                    generated between multiple fields, the interaction of science with everyday life, and the
                    possibility to make decisions with the objective of generating a benefit whose impact is fair and
                    responsible.
                    <br><br> In short, since probably not everyone has a robust technical vocabulary to understand the
                    totality of a scientific topic, in this section we seek to explain science using much more
                    understandable elements to society, allowing the complex problems to permeate their thinking more
                    easily and enabling the comprehension of the versatility of the field.

                                    This idea emerged from the need to democratize synthetic biology in the university
                                    environment and to divulge the topic even further in Costa Rica, particularly to
                                    non-biotechnology engineers. It was also our intent to motivate participation in
                                    research or competitions such as iGEM, to demonstrate that anyone can be part of
                                    these spaces, make valuable contributions through discussion, brainstorming, and
                                    innovate with ideas that previously only seemed to belong to science fiction.

                                    We’ve developed material that can be implemented for the teaching of virtualized

                                    tool that not only simulates what a science student would do in real life, but
                                    receives detailed step-by-step information according to progress in practice. In

                <p class="">
                    The context of a project, including the country's legal, political and commercial frameworks,
                    although usually undervalued and considered in afterthought, is one of the most important
                    considerations that make a project possible. As a reflection of this, we received valuable
                    first-hand information from entrepreneurs and researchers who have had to face limitations that
                    probably go beyond their basal professional expertise and who have somehow had to learn how to carry
                    on on their own. They, at the same time, realizing that it was a complex process, have decided to
                    share with us what they know in order to involve us as communicators of the experiences and
                    recommendations collected, from, to and for the biotechnology field. For the implementation, as
                    detailed previously, we directly contacted users for our tools and our knowledge, making sure that
                    the problem we decided to tackle was real and that our solution and vision were correctly portrayed
                    and received with interest.

                        areas, along with others related to the project in different ways, that somehow became the
                        scaffold that served as a guide to present a quality project and at the same time capable of
                        becoming a real and useful {Foundational advance} of reference to be implemented horizontally by
                        providing the groundwork for future teams, and that way continue supporting and building of
                        scientific research as it has been done on this proiect with the feedback received, as detailed
                        in the {Experts feedback section}.

                From the beginning we were fascinated by the <b> endless possibilities</b> synthetic biology grants.
                <b>Anything that you can imagine can be done</b>, with the right amount of:

                <div class="red-text" style="text-transform: uppercase;">
                    research, knowledge, time, dedication and creativity.
                </div>


                This made us look for ways to <b> expand synthetic biology’s outreach </b> while maintaining <b>high
                    ethical, technical and safety standards</b>. The foundational advance track was a clear path ahead
                to fulfill our
                goal.
            </div>
            <div class="HomeTitle HomeTitle3">
                Once settled in this track we started researching and chose a problem that we believe is so ingrained
                within the standard development process of genetic circuits that it has been overlooked. Even further,
                the possible applications that a different way of thinking, designing, constructing and developing
                genetic circuits might enable are difficult to come by to say the least. It was evident that

                <div class="red-text" style="text-transform: uppercase;">
                    a tool, a framework, a foundation was needed.
                </div>

                Hopefully the tools we develop in this project, and the project itself become the foundation of many
                other projects to come. It’s this hope that inspires to do the best work we can think of, and maybe
                more.

                To pursue an incipient focus on genetic circuit development, based on sequential logic, that can enable
                a whole new set of genetic functions and expand the possible applications for engineered organisms,
                making way for the scientists of tomorrow to continue in this line of research.

                Currently genetic circuits being developed are biased to their core by combinatorial logic meaning that
                most functions are achieved by specific input - output relationships which limits functionality, circuit
                architecture and possible applications since logic gates are rigid, complex when combined and
                unresponsive to a key element:

                We propose a framework based on sequential logic. Which is much more similar to nature’s, responsive to
                time and state, and whose potential has not yet been fully exploited, serving as tool for new
                implementations and applications.

                We aim to expand synthetic biology’s frontiers, leading the way for many others to come. The path we are

                commitment, perseverance and innovation. These values have permeated our work, which is intended to be
                an advance towards scientific democratization and positive social impact.

                        <h2>Counter</h2>
                        <p>
The architecture of the counter module itself is <b>novel and one of a kind</b>, allowing a count more efficient than any existing one and permitting its own reset, which furthers its efficiency and gives rise to different counter-reset designs and applications. It harnesses <b>serine recombinases’</b> potential, building up on previous authors work while giving it a special twist marked by the application of <b>sequential logic</b>.

                        <h2>Initiation Module </h2>
                        <p>
Offers a great way to <b>prevent the start</b> of the counter module during lab work, an essential requirement for our project but also many other synthetic biology systems that can’t rely on inducible promoters (positive feedback) for this purpose.

                        <h2>Overcount Prevention</h2>
                        <p>
This regulatory module is a game changer for counter systems, since one of the main deficits that already developed counters have is the <b>lack of discrete counting</b> in the presence of continuous input, which makes characterization and experimental optimization a very exhausting task. Also, since it’s a regulatory module that’s designed to fit all, it can be used for regulation in any other genetic circuit that might need it.

                        <p>
Along with the counter module, “amplify” allows a theoretically endless amount of resets, making the count <b>virtually infinite</b>. Its design also gives rise to new possibilities for other circuits which could be modified to allow the incorporation of the circuit in order to <b>expand or improve their performance</b>, particularly in the area of genetic editions and metabolic engineering. It’s also a simple way to <b>adapt</b> already existing devices to fulfill sequential logic functions.

                        In order to make this knowledge more available, we have organized our research and findings and
                        included them in our conceptual framework. The conceptual framework itself encompassess even
                        more, it’s where we propose a <b>guide</b> for conceptualizing, modeling and representing biological
                        elements, such as genes and proteins along with their interactions among themselves and the
                        environment. The development process for this guideline was complex and time consuming,
                        requiring discussion, research and decision making, because of which we documented the
                        troubleshooting process that it entailed.

                        To make the conceptual framework’s application more tangible, we developed the specification for
                        a software framework, which organises the <b>workflow</b> of the previously conceptualized parts in
                        order to build, assess and manipulate genetic circuits.

                        This makes software development more accessible for researchers and other iGEM teams, while
                        maintaining <b>flexibility</b> in the implementation and optimization. This can be used by iGEMers and
                        scientists to develop their own software proposals.

                    <p>
In addition to be in an abstract category like foundational advance, our project has an enormous potential with a <b>wide plasticity</b>, which makes clustering it for potential users a complex task, so we decided to <b>consult</b> professionals from different areas, to get feedback on what they thought of the project in a positive and negative way and how they would see different uses according to <b>their experience</b> and the way they could be applied on their own projects and investigations. This not only promoted a dialogue that allowed the improvement of the project and the consideration of aspects that were not initially visualized, but also extended the coverage of <b>possible implementations</b> of our genetic circuit, framework and software. Also, we believe this approach can be used by future teams who have abstract projects and/or believe in having a <b>closer relationship</b> with users. This creates a basis to understand what a user might actually look for in an application or product and thus make the necessary modifications to convert our idea into a <b>functional reality</b>. It also involved a large group of teachers and researchers from different universities who had never before become familiar with the iGEM initiative or related projects, so this highlights our interest in <b>increasing the reach</b> of synthetic biology in the country and thus seeking the support needed to continue scientific development.

The search for ways to <b>mitigate the impact</b> of man on the planet, to repay it the benefits that has given to us as growing professionals and human beings or simply to try to <b>find solutions</b> based on what it is already around us, is part of the task in which not only dedicated or enthusiastic scientists should be involved, but it must be a whole network of circular support. Environmental and moral concerns should be involved from the process of having an idea, making this idea a creation, to each of its ramifications and resulting coincidences. Our main <b>values</b> considered in order to cover all the potential risks and keep them in mind are: integrity, responsibility, balance, accountability, commitment, perseverance and innovation; all of them with the intention of having under control not only the specific project parts and their interactions but also the whole range of applications.

                    know how difficult it can be to recruit participants, not because of unwillingness, but because of
                    lack of information. Hence, we consider it vital not only to <b>tell our experience</b> as a
                    team, but also to spread the word and motivate others about the possibility to participate, making
                    it a point to evidence that they do not have to be experts in synbio to be able to develop projects
                    of <b>high value</b>.
                    With synbio clubs we encourage the search for <b>interdisciplinarity, creativity</b> and interest in having

                        Our documentation serves as good reference for other teams to build on this area and develop

                    <p>As an interdisciplinary team, we know scientific communication is complicated for both people who
                        are not in STEM, or in a different field, but also for scientists to develop.

                        Therefore, the two previous points unite on the integral communication of the project.

                        For this, design has been applied in every sense with a <b>functional interest</b> in mind: our desire
                        is for our content to not be just pretty, but to precisely be able to communicate what we mean
                        and who we are in an efficient and easy to understand manner.
                        This is applied throughout the entire project, from the wiki and its content, to the management
                        of the brand in social networks and the video-presentations used throughout the competition.

                        For this endeavour we used other iGEM teams’ wikis and content as reference and inspiration, and
                        in turn, we hope ours can serve the same purpose.

                        Making use of social sciences’ research principles and perspective a huge impact can be made in
                        <b>understanding and involving public opinion</b> as we establish in the content developed in order to make this perspective accessible for other teams to follow our example without being experts.

                        In our country, Costa Rica, we have the great responsibility to preserve the biological
                        resources we have, and this complicates the bureaucracy to carry out research processes related
                        to the synthetic biology area.

                        This motivated us to investigate the current biotechnological <b>legal frameworks</b> in our country,
                        the bodies responsible for ensuring compliance, the necessary permissions and requirements,
                        among other aspects based on the previous research carried out for the same purpose in Mexico by
                        the UANL team and Ohio state's team in 2020.

                        This can serve as future reference for other teams who wish to do this research, and for Costa
                        Rican scientists to refer to when needed.

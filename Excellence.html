                                Establishing this mindset from the beginning of the project and having it as its core
                                has made our solution really meet the needs of our users and extend the positive impact
                                on the scientific community.
                                We invite other iGEM teams to follow this line of work in their own projects and
                                highlight the key role of involving designers early in the project to succeed in this
                                area.

                            <p class="wiki-card-2columns">
                                Every user-centered design process is based on these 5 stages. Empathy, define, devise,
                                prototype and test.

                                This methodology allows achieving results with a high level of innovation and user
                                satisfaction. We are looking for ways to apply these phases in a general way within each
                                of the development areas of our project.

                                The turning point in this methodology, as its name implies, is to focus all development
                                on the user and to really solve the needs they have. For our team, on the part of the
                                designers, it was important to expand the user concept.

                                This, because normally it is believed that the user is only, in this case,
                                the scientist who will use our tool; but not only, in this case users are also our
                                judges, each person who uses the wiki, each igemer who sees our exhibition materials at
                                any meet up, etc.
                                
                                This was a big challenge for non-designers to tackle, but at the end of the road, we
                                think we embraced it so well, that the results were better than expected. 
                                
                                One of the best contributions that this mindset had within the project was that the
                                applications for it were extracted directly from the feedback of our end users.
                                
                                This allows us to devise and validate, in a single step, the potential for use and
                                usefulness of our tool. 
                                
                                On the other hand, this mindset is reflected in each of the resources used during the 
                                development of the competition. From the promo-video to the wiki.

                                As a team, it was important for us to create a brand that was consistent and 
                                communicated the essence of our project effectively. Which is why we dedicated 
                                time towards defining what this looked like for all of us. The process began by 
                                defining the characteristics we wanted to represent with our brand.
                                
                                Furthermore, our team was sure that we wanted to incorporate the idea of time, 
                                DNA or bacteria in our design.
                                
                                After receiving this input, we were able to set to work on created a logo that 
                                met with most if not all our requirements, defining our color paletter and our 
                                chosen typography.
                                
                                Our brand is not something that is only visible in our logo but in consistency 
                                throughout our work, that makes it unique to our team and recognizable.

                            <p class="wiki-card-2columns">
                                Due to the characteristics of our project, we knew that its effective communication 
                                would not be easy, so we have created a narrative through our project, which has
                                facilitated the communication and interaction of the team both internally and with
                                users.
                                
                                Our documentation serves as good reference for other teams to  build on this area 
                                and develop their own stories.
                                
                                This narrative evolved during each iteration of use it had. In meet-ups, interviews
                                with users, internal team practices, among others.
                                
                                This did not allow us to validate with small steps over time, what was the most 
                                effective way to communicate our project and the specific messages that we want to 
                                transmit with it.
                                
                                The narrative, in addition to seeking the effectiveness of communication, is 
                                important to maintain the interest of the viewer.
                                
                                This mainly due to the complexity of concepts and topics to be dealt with in general 
                                during the competition. In products like the presentation video, even the promo
                                video, this narrative played a fundamental role in our successful development of 
                                these.

                            <p class="wiki-card-2columns">
                                In relation to the narrative, an aspect to which we pay special attention, both in 
                                the wiki and the videos, the search for synonyms and grammar work was of great value.
                                
                                This allowed us to play with the tones and ideas, to maintain the attention of the 
                                viewer / reader and in the same way clearly communicate what was desired.
                                
                                As an interdisciplinary team, we know scientific communication is complicated for
                                both people who are not in STEM, or in a different field, but also for scientists
                                to develop.
                                
                                Therefore, the two previous points unite on the integral communication of the project.
                                
                                For this, design has been applied in every sense with a functional interest in mind:
                                our desire is for our content to not be just pretty, but to precisely be able to 
                                communicate what we mean and who we are in an efficient and easy to understand manner.
                                
                                This is applied throughout the entire project, from the wiki and its content, to the
                                management of the brand in social networks and the video-presentations used 
                                throughout the competition.
                                
                                For this endeavour we used other iGEM teams’ wikis and content as reference and 
                                inspiration, and in turn, we hope ours can serve the same purpose.

                                Taking advantage of the opportunity to have several designers and developers on
                                the team, we decided to pay special attention to our wiki.
                                
                                Ux as a creative discipline has grown exponentially in recent years. Its direct
                                impact on digital products has made people increasingly demanding with the sites 
                                they access.
                                
                                For this reason, we focus on having a complete design process with our wiki.
                                
                                Following the idea of thought dictated by the user-driven mindset, in 
                                conjunction with communication efforts, our design process followed all the 
                                stages that a procedure of this type normally follows.
                                
                                An exploration and definition phase, where we explore the requirements of the 
                                competition, in conjunction with the specific needs of our project.
                                
                                With this we created a base architecture, with which we began to develop the 
                                exploration of different ways of presenting the information, normally called 
                                wireframes.

                                From this exploration we create an adaptive system. This system allows us to 
                                define different graphic styles, maintaining unity and harmony throughout the
                                brand's design.

                                This system also facilitates the programming of the wiki, since it maintains 
                                specific guidelines throughout the design and structure.

                                This system was specifically designed with the objective of allowing the 
                                adaptability of the information and limiting the "endless scroll" to the 
                                extreme.
                                
                                In the research of references that was carried out for this process, we realized 
                                that the vast majority of wikis abused this resource, which is extremely 
                                detrimental to the user experience on any site.

                                For this reason, the adaptability of the information became more important, since
                                the structuring of the sections and their presentation had to be very well 
                                designed each one.

                                So we decided to dedicate a large part of the process to correctly defining the 
                                system before the final development of the wiki.

                                One of the first questions to be asked isn’t how can synthetic biology solve this
                                issue? But instead, is a synthetic biology approach right for this particular problem?

                                For this question to be answered in the best possible manner it’s necessary to 
                                brainstorm to not only come up with
                                new solutions but to describe the issue thoroughly.

                                For this, an interdisciplinary group must be assembled in order to understand the 
                                different dimensions and implications of the problem.

                                The multidisciplinarity ensures the presence of several perspectives, and the inclusion 
                                of social scientists allows an in depth look at society as a root cause and possible user, 
                                along with diverse methodologies to study these subjects.
                                
                                Open discussion will also favor creativity and the creation of a solution that’s feasible 
                                and possible in as many dimensions as possible. The understanding of the problem is key to 
                                addressing it correctly.

                                Better understanding of the possible impact and implications of a synthetic biology project.

                                Once the path to achieve the development of the solution is laid out, a robust risk assessment
                                must be done, and, in order for this assessment to be accurate, social scientists must be 
                                involved since the impact and implications are directly related to society itself.

                                Ethical considerations can be made through the understanding of risks, impacts and implications.

                                When including social scientists and other stakeholders such as politicians, policy makers and
                                ___, the extent of the considerations and their impact can be amplified.

                                The groundwork for ethical applications, regulation and use for the developed tools can be
                                introduced before the tool has even been developed. This works as an advantage for scientists 
                                and developers in many ways.

                                Firstly, they can ensure that the regulations are fair and open to innovation by helping to guide
                                the process and being directly involved in it.
                                
                                Also, political considerations can be taken into account beforehand, giving developers the
                                opportunity to have a voice on decision making before the issue moves to bureaucratic spheres.

                                Conversation can also be made with different sectors and stakeholders, even possible users, to fully 
                                understand consequences and obstacles and include plans to prevent and mitigate them instead of only

                                Nonetheless, this might not be evident for people educated in basic sciences, since there’s 
                                usually not a class to address these concerns in STEM oriented mallas curriculares.

                                Related to the aforementioned point, synthetic biologists and biotechnologists may not always 
                                have a true understanding of the techniques used for interacting with other people in order to
                                obtain their opinions and perspective.

                                This is why the involvement of social scientists is key to setting the investigation subject 
                                and its goals, the operationalization of objectives and the planning out of the methodologies 
                                to achieve them.
                                
                                In social sciences this stage is as important as carrying out the work, which is why special 
                                attention must be paid to it.

                                            - What is the issue you want to tackle? 

                                            - What are its origins and root-causes? Are they social? Is it a symptom
                                            or the actual disease? Is there any structural issue behind this?

                                            - Is there anyone else tackling it? How?

                                            - Should synthetic biology solve this issue? Will it really solve this issue completely? If it solves it partially, what aspects aren’t you tackling?
                                            Why?  Is this ok?

                                            - Should this problem be addressed from other perspectives as well?

                                            - Whose interests are being taken into account? Why?
                                            
                                           
                                            <em>Choosing a solution:</em>

                                            - Think about your proposed solution(s) and other possible ways to tackle this problem (not necessarily related to synthetic biology or even science itself), what do these other options imply? What does your approach imply? On a scientific level? On a social level? On an economic level? On a cultural level? On a political level? 

                                            - Compare the alternatives, which of them has the most impact on some levels? Which? On all levels? Is the impact positive or negative? Could it be both? 

                                            -  In contrast to the other alternatives, is your project the best suited, most robust solution? Is it feasible? 

                                            - What will you need in order to guarantee or improve this feasibility? (F.E.: Risk assessment. Environmental impact assessment. Involving other areas. Target population (who is the target user). Policy involved. Future outlook. Etc.)  

                                            - Think about the aspects of the problem you left out. Is your solution actually solving a problem or just transforming it/making it someone else’s? To abarcar these aspects, who else should be involved in order to truly solve this problem? How can you set forward on making the necessary allegiances? Is it possible to do so? How?
                                            
                                            
                                            <em>Assessing your solution and its implications:</em>
                                            - Can your solution be used in any other way? Can it be weaponized? Can it be used to fulfill imperialistic purposes regarding the environment or others? 

                                            - Is the real interest to solve the problem or to monetize from solving the problem? Is this ethical? Is your marketing plan in the best interest for everyone involved? Will it be beneficial to some but not all? 

                                            - How can this solution be influenced, and how can it influence others? Would your solution behave as an excuse to continue exhibiting consumerism, acaparación de recursos, centralización del dinero, and justify other unethical and unconscious behaviors?

                                            - Is it necessary to educate the user? The general public? Why? Is it your responsibility? How should this be addressed, by whom and in which level?

                                            - Have you searched and listened for concerns regarding your solution? Who have you involved? Are you excluding any relevant stakeholder? How can you broaden your capacity to listen?

                                            - How can you commit to the ethical and moral use of your technology? How can you involve stakeholders and encourage them to do the same? Do you have a say on it’s possible use? How can you get a voice? How can you amplify other’s voices? How can you hold users, regulators, stakeholders and yourself accountable? Can consequences be instituted? How? By whom?

                                            - Your science will be mercantilized, how will you deal with that? Will “selling” your project compromise its integrity? How can you prevent that? How transparent should you be? Is your science going to be accessible?

                                In our country, Costa Rica, we have the great responsibility to preserve the biological
                                resources we have, and this complicates the bureaucracy to carry out research processes
                                related to the synthetic biology area.
                                
                                This motivated us to investigate the current biotechnological legal frameworks in our 
                                country, the bodies responsible for ensuring compliance, the necessary permissions and
                                requirements, among other aspects based on the previous research carried out for the
                                same purpose in Mexico by the UANL team and Ohio state's team in 2020.

                                This can serve as future reference for other teams who wish to do this research, and for 
                                Costa Rican scientists to refer to when needed.
